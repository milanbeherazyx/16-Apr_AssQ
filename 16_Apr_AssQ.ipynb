    "> Boosting is a machine learning technique that involves iteratively training weak models (also known as base or weak learners) and then combining them to create a strong model. In boosting, each subsequent model is trained with a focus on the data points that were previously misclassified or underrepresented. By doing so, boosting seeks to improve the performance of the model on the difficult-to-classify examples. Boosting is an ensemble learning method, meaning it combines multiple models to achieve better performance than any single model on its own."

    ">In boosting, the training data is re-weighted at each iteration, with more weight given to misclassified examples in order to focus on the \"hard\" examples that are difficult to classify. At each iteration, a new base model is trained on the re-weighted training data. The base models are typically weak models such as decision trees, which have low bias but high variance.\n",

By combining multiple such models, boosting can create a strong model with lower variance and better predictive accuracy.
